Based off of the idea behind Number Munchers

The idea is that a chicken moves within a grid.  Each square
of the grid contains answers to a problem posed as an image
outside of the grid.  The player moves around the grid and 
eats the correct answers.

Typical questions and answers can be simple arithmetic problems,
vocabulary, etc.
